# WPS common contracts

This project contains a set of contracts for _design by contract_. The contracts follow the following naming scheme:

- Methods starting with __require__ are preconditions, which are used to check arguments
- Methods starting with __check__ are state checks or invariants, which are used to check intermediate results for consistency
- Methods starting with __ensure__ are postconditions, which are used to check results before returning them 


## The contracts

The (static) methods implementing different contracts are grouped in the following classes:

- [`BaseContracts`](./src/main/java/de/wps/common/contracts/BaseContracts.java) to test for nullability and simple boolean conditions.
- [`CollectionContracts`](./src/main/java/de/wps/common/contracts/CollectionContracts.java) to test collections for nullability and emptiness.
- [`StringContracts`](./src/main/java/de/wps/common/contracts/StringContracts.java) to test strings for emptiness and blankness (and nullability).

## Maven coordinates

Releases can be found in Maven central under the following coordinates:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.wps.common</groupId>
    <artifactId>common-contracts</artifactId>
    <version>0.6</version>
</dependency>
```

If you do not want to get the (only) transitive dependency `org.checkerframework:check-qual`, you can exclude it:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.wps.common</groupId>
    <artifactId>common-contracts</artifactId>
    <version>0.6</version>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.checkerframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>checker-qual</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```
